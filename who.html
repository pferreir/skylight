          <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
          <p>I am a Software Engineer and Open Source Developer. I am currently living in Geneva, Switzerland and I work at <a href="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</a>, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics.</p>

          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>I'm one of the two core developers of the <a href="http://indico-software.org">Indico Project</a>. Read more about it <a href="#indico">here</a>.

          <p>My main programming language nowadays is <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> (with some bits of front-end JavaScript) but I occasionally do some side work in Ruby and Java. However, I am totally against this whole language wars thing. I believe that in the end it's all about what's the best language for the job, not the one you're crazy for. And a developer that is worth such a classification has to be flexible as to learn a new language with ease.

          <p>I've done mostly web development in my professional life, at different levels of the software stack. However, experience brought more responsibility and nowadays an increasing share of my time is spent reviewing other people's code and approving/rejecting patches, proposing code and style improvements as well as fixing bugs. I still get to do some "from scratch" development though.</p>

          <p>My interest for Web matters doesn't end in programming - I am always in tune with the latest web standards and practices, I like to see what other people are doing and what tomorrow's web apps will look like. I like the way in which web APIs are becoming more ubiquitous, and I feel there's a huge potential that may come from cross-collaboration.</p>

          <h3>Languages</h3>
          <p>Speaking of "real world" human languages, I speak 4 of them: Portuguese, English, Spanish and French. I am currently (slowly) learning Italian.</p>
          <p>Portuguese is my mother tongue and English my main foreign language and the one I speak the most on a daily basis. I can have fairly decent conversations in Spanish and French, but don't expect the same degree of spontaneity. I still bump into some vocabulary gaps particularly in French, even though my grammar is pretty advanced.</p>
