<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>I am an active part of several open source projects, including small pet projects that help me keep up to date with different technologies while having some extra-work fun.</p>
<h3 id="indico" data-github="indico/indico">Indico</h3>
<a href="http://indico-software.org">Indico</a> - This is my main projectand the most important aspect of my job. Indico is the system that is used for event management and scheduling at CERN. It is also the organization's "Collaboration Hub", a gateway to all videoconferencing and chat services;

<h3 data-github="pferreir/radiocrepe">Radiocrepe</h3>
<p>This is supposed to be the perfect office audio streaming jukebox. You basically bring your MP3 to work in a hard disk and let Radiocrepe index them in a central location. Your co-workers will be able to browse the global list of songs and mark them for play. They'll be able to vote for each song and thus influence their playing order.</p>

<h3 data-github="pferreir/octopress-wikipedia">Octopress Wikipedia</h3>
A very simple plugin for <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> that allows you to embed Wikipedia definitions inside your articles. Here's <a href="http://pferreir.github.com/2012/06/19/medieval-mysteries/">an example</a>.

<h3 data-github="pferreir/ds18b20">ds18b20</h3>
A small Arduino driver for the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/245">DS18B20</a> temperature sensor. Nothing special, really. I published it in the hope that it would make someone's life easier.
